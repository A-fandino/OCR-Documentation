# üìñ Introduction to OCR 
> A brief introduction to OCR. How does it work and use cases.


## ‚ùì What is OCR?

```Optical Character Recognition```

*OCR* is a way to extract text from an **image** üñºÔ∏è in order to be used by a **machine/computer** üíª.

Those algorithms take images as INPUT and give text as OUTPUT.

## üõ†Ô∏è Use cases

- Convert documents to PDF
- Extract data from *Bank* or *ID* cards 
- [Real world translation](https://support.google.com/translate/answer/6142483?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid)
- [Extract text from YouTube videos](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/selectext-copy-text-from/gkkdmjjodidppndkbkhhknakbeflbomf?hl=en)
- [Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR)](https://www.jdpower.com/cars/shopping-guides/what-is-traffic-sign-recognition)
- [Vehicle plate recognition](./examples/car_plates/)
- Data storage **???** (Probably not ideal)

## üì∏ Prepare the images

OCR algorithms tend to be a bit *sensitive* so it's important to **preprocess** the images in order to get the desired output.

To preprocess the image we can apply a variety of filters but there are a few things that have to be taken into account before:

 - üî¶ Lighting conditions
    - Is there enough light? Or too much?
 - üñºÔ∏è Perspective

 We now could improve the image conditions so the image can be easier to read. 
 
 Otherwise we can try to compensate those conditions with the next steps.

 - ‚òØÔ∏è Text constrast with the background
 - üî§ Language and characters
 - üñäÔ∏è Typography
 - ü§≥ Image quality

 Now that we know the conditions of the image we can apply some of the following filters:
 - Binarization
 - Inversion (Negative filter)
 - Dilation
 - Erosion
 - Noise reduction
    - Gaussian Blur
    - Median Blur
    - Bilateral Filtering
 - Transformations
    - Cropping: Manual or with **object detection**
    - Rotation
 - [More filters](https://medium.com/technovators/survey-on-image-preprocessing-techniques-to-improve-ocr-accuracy-616ddb931b76)
 These techniques will help us get a more clear input, reducing the image noise and issolating the characters we want to read.

## Clear the output

If things went right, we should have recieved an output from our image. *But is it what we expected?*

### Confidence

OCR algorithms and libraries usually return a list of characters/words and a cofidence percentaje for each one of those.

We could throw up the results that have a small percentaje of confidence.

### REGEX

[Regular Expressions](https://www.regular-expressions.info/) are a way to find patterns in texts.

This way we could find and/or remove patterns like:
 - Multiple commas: ```/[,{2,}]/``` Matches: *,,* or *,,,,,*
 - Plate formatting: ```/\d{4}\w?[A-Z]{3}/``` Matches: *0123 AAA* or *9999BCD*

## ‚å®Ô∏è Talk is cheap. Show me the code.

All this theory is useless without applying it to the practice.
So I have prepared a pair of projects to demostrate the capabilities (and limitations) of OCR:

For these two I have used [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract)

### Vehicle plate recognition

A small and basic script that detects and reads vehicle plates. (Tested with Spain plates): [Code here](./examples/car_plates/)

### Realtime text recognition

A webapp that reads from the device's camera in realtime. 
It lets the user configure the filters so the preprocessing can be adjusted to a variety of situations.
