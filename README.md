## ‚ùì What is OCR?

>**O**ptical **C**haracter **R**ecognition

*OCR* is a way to extract text from an **image** üñºÔ∏è in order to be used by a **machine/computer** üíª.

They take images as INPUT and give text as output.

## üõ†Ô∏è Use cases

- Convert documents to PDF
- Extract data from *Bank* or *ID* cards 
- [Real world translation](https://support.google.com/translate/answer/6142483?hl=en&co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid)
- [Extract text from YouTube videos](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/selectext-copy-text-from/gkkdmjjodidppndkbkhhknakbeflbomf?hl=en)
- [Traffic Sign Recognition (TSR)](https://www.jdpower.com/cars/shopping-guides/what-is-traffic-sign-recognition)
- [Vehicle plate recognition]()***
- Data storage **???** (Probably not ideal)

## Types of OCR Algorithms

## ‚õëÔ∏è How does it work


## üì∏ Prepare the images

OCR algorithms tend to be a bit *sensitive* so it's import to **preprocess** the images in order to get the desired output.

To preprocess the image we can apply a variety of filters but there are a few things that have to be taken into account before:

 - Lighting conditions
 - Angle
 - Text color
 - Text constrast with the background
 - Language and characters
 - Typography



## Clear the output

### Vehicle plate recognition

A small and basic script that detects and reads vehicle plates. (Tested with Spain plates): [Code here](./examples/car_plates/)

### Realtime text recognition

A webapp that reads from the device's camera in realtime. 
It lets the user configure the filters so the preprocessing can be adjusted to its needs.
